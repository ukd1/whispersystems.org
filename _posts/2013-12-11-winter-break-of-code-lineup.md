title: "Blog >> WBoC Lineup"
layout: post
---

After our wonderful experience with [Spring Break Of Code](https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure), we were excited to try this
again.  Even with high expectations based on our experience in the Spring, the response was still better than what
we could have hoped for.  The hundreds of high quality proposals we received were really inspiring, and
we hope that one day we can get a space large enough for all of the amazing people who are passionate 
about the development of privacy enhancing technology.

We think the final lineup of those attending in January is going to be great:

XXXXX

**Rhodey** ([@notrhodey](https://twitter.com/notrhodey)) space, privacy, robits and the cheaper things in life. I plan 
to spend WBoC working on Secure Sync, a contact and calendar synchronization service for Android featuring end-to-end
encryption. I also hope to prepare "Zones" for release on Google Play by closing what is left of the GitHub issues and 
polishing other bits.

**Christine Corbett** ([@corbett](https://twitter.com/corbett)) Christine Corbett Moran is a PhD candidate in Computational 
Astrophysics alongside actively contributing to mobile products for social good. In her spare time, she enjoys skating for 
the Zurich City Roller Girlz roller derby team, adventure sports, and world travel. At WBoC she'll be continuing development 
of TextSecure iOS and her surfing technique.

<img alt="Meskio" src="/blog/images/meskio-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Meskio** ([meskio](http://meskio.net)) I'm a computer geek interested on the possibilities that new technologies bring 
to empower people. I love to learn programming languages and develop free software. I've being working for the past two 
years at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland) as a C++ developer in the control system of the accelerators. I'm a maniac of mountains 
and traveling, going to remote places searching for new routes to climb. At the WBoC I'll be working on adding OpenStreetMap 
support to Zones and squashing bugs on TextSecure.

<img alt="Ellie Frost" src="/blog/images/ellie-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" />
**Ellie Frost** ([@stillinbeta](https://twitter.com/stillinbeta)) I'm a software engineer, 
presently working towards a degree in computer science at the University of Toronto. I like open source, distributed systems, 
and vegan food. I dislike single points of failure, untested code, and patriarchy.

I will be working on a system for distributing APKs, collecting statistics, and handling crash reports outside of the 
Google Play framework. This will make it easier to run Open WhisperSystems' software on Android devices without Google's
proprietary software.

<img alt="Matt Corallo" src="/blog/images/matt-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" />
**Matt Corallo** Matt is a senior Computer Science student at UNC. He has been a developer on the Bitcoin Core client 
(the most popular Bitcoin client) for over two years and the bitcoinj library (the most popular library which
powers the top mobile client and several desktop clients) for over a year. His research interests include software 
mechanisms for protecting systems against physical attacks and practical secure systems. During the WBoC, Matt will be 
working to implement browser extensions for TextSecure and RedPhone to allow users access to their text messages and
phone calls outside of their smartphone.

<img alt="Meghana" src="/blog/images/meghana-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Meghana Khandekar** ([@mkhandekar](https://twitter.com/mkhandekar)) Meghana is a MFA Interaction Design student at School of 
Visual Arts in New York. She explores the way people interact with others, technology & products, and ultimately improves those 
experiences. She has worked with startups, Berkman Center, World Bank, and UNICEF to design software & systems solutions to 
improve access to & delivery of services and information. Through this work experience she has come to design for discourse 
around human rights, freedom of expression and digital security.

Meghana's primary goal for the week will be understanding Open WhisperSystems' mission, audience & brand attributes, the 
market(s) to which it belongs, its competitors and collaborators and the desired perception & image within those groups. All this 
will inform Open WhisperSystems' new branding, website design, and communication strategy. If time permits, that work could 
influence aspects of TextSecure and RedPhone design and user experience as well.

<img alt="Jake" src="/blog/images/jake-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left" />
**Jake McGinty** I like the distorted, the unexpected, and solid colors. To pass the time I am enjoying my sensory inputs, 
providing sensory output, and generally trying to find good problems around free information. I am in awe at the doors 
technology has opened as well as its amazing potential for unintended consequences. I'm always searching for the secrets 
of the human factor and the subtle effects technology has on our behavior. I'll be working on improving the look and feel 
of TextSecure, stomping out bugs, as well as filling some outstanding feature requests to pump up TextSecure's client-side 
security. Beyond that, hopping around, learning, contributing, falling into water a lot, and generally mushing minds together.

<img alt="Lilia" src="/blog/images/lilia-wboc.jpg" class="nice-left"/>
**Lilia Kai** ([@liliakai](https://twitter.com/liliakai)) As a web developer for the EFF, and given my laser-enhanced 20/15 
visual acuity, I'm pretty much a superhero. Other hats I've worn include Arduino hacker, duck farmer, and pro yoyoer. 
This winter break I'll be using my superpowers to ensure that no matter what device, browser, search engine, or screen 
size you prefer, the Open WhisperSystems website is always looking good!

**Tyler Reinhard** ([@abolishme](https://twitter.com/abolishme)) Tyler is a [workflow publisher](http://abolish.me), 
designer, front-end web developer, and [social theorist](https://twitter.com/mask_mag) living in Brooklyn, NY. He's been 
involved with Whisper Systems since the original beta, and is currently working on the iOS interface for a new implementation 
of Open WhisperSystems secure communication software. Tyler is also the co-founder of [Mask Magazine](http://www.maskmagazine.com),
a style magazine for antagonist youth.

**Moxie Marlinspike** ([@moxie](https://twitter.com/moxie)) Interested in the tension towards the unmediated,
combined with a strange passion for secure protocols.  Ultimately, we also needed someone there to wash the dishes.
