The rumors are true.  We want Open Source secure communication to be ubiquitous, so we're working towards making our apps 
available in as many popular environments as we can, starting with the addition of iOS.  

Development for RedPhone on iOS has been underway since the beginning of the year, and development for TextSecure on iOS
got off to an amazing start at this year's [Spring Break Of Code](https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure).

We're on track to start releasing iPhone apps by the end of the summer.  You can sign up above to be notified when these apps
become available (we'll only ever use your email to let you know about new Open Whisper Systems iPhone apps).

And of course, Android users can already download our apps [from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Open+Whisper+Systems).
