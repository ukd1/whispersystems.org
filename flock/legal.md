#Privacy Policy

Flock provides you with end-to-end encrypted sync for contacts and calendars across Android
devices. All the content you sync between your devices appears to Flock Sync as an encrypted stream.
We cannot decrypt or otherwise access your content.

## Information We Have

### 1. Information you give us
  * Username

  * Authentication password
      - Your encryption password is never visible to Open Whisper Systems. Your authentication password is separate and is used to verify your user identity.
      - We hash the authentication passwords before they're stored in our database.

  * Crash reports

    If Flock crashes on a user's device, the user has the option of sending OWS a crash report. This will send OWS a copy of the information contained in the user's debug log.
      + This information is only sent to OWS on the express command and with the express consent of the user.
      + The information sent to OWS only contains information specific to Flock -- crash reports do not include information about other apps on your device.
      + The information sent to OWS in a crash report will only be used for development purposes.
      + Debug reports are publicly accessible online.

  * Subscription information

    Flock Sync uses [Stripe](http://stripe.com/), a third-party payment processor to link your payment
    information to your Flock Sync account. You can choose to make your payments with a credit/debit
    card or with Bitcoin.

    Regardless of which payment method you choose, OWS will have access to the following
    information:

      - Date of Flock Sync account creation
      - Stripe customer ID number
      - Whether or not the last charge on the Stripe account failed
      - Whether or not auto-renew is enabled for the subscription
      - Subscription history

In connection with your subscription, Flock Sync may request the following transaction details from the
Stripe (any information so obtained will be subject to this Privacy Policy):

  + If you use a credit card
      - Last 4 digits of the card number
      - Card expiration date

  + If you use Bitcoin
      - Flock Sync may request bitcoin transaction details from Stripe

Information you share with Stripe is not stored by Whisper Systems. You can read Stripe's
Privacy Policy [here](https://stripe.com/us/privacy).

The processing of payments in connection with your subscription will be subject to the terms,
conditions and privacy policies of the payment processor and of your credit card issuer or
Bitcoin service provider, in addition to this Agreement. Flock Sync is not responsible for any error
that occurs during payment processing.

### 2. Information we gather from your use of the application
  + IP addresses
      - The IP address is temporarily saved in our server logs for purposes of server administration.
      - We may check usage statistics to identify and avoid potential abuse.
      - This data is retained for 30 days, after which point we no longer have access to it.

  + OWS does not automatically collect any usage statistics from the app.

## How We Use Information

When you choose to report a crash to OWS by sending us a debug log, we may publish the text of the
crash report for the ongoing improvement and development of Flock.

When you contact Open Whisper Systems, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any
issues you are facing with the application.

  + Open Whisper Systems does not request or store personally identifying contact information of Flock Sync users.
  + If a Flock user wishes to contact Open Whisper Systems, they can email us directly (support@whispersystems.org). Users are also welcome to join discussion at [support.whispersystems.org](http://support.whispersystems.org), rate the application on the Google Play store, participate in the development of the application on GitHub, and engage with OWS directly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/whispersystems).

## Transparency and Choice
Flock's development is ongoing and publicly available on GitHub. Uploaded crash reports are
published online.

Flock Sync users need not provide OWS with any personally identifying information beyond the IP address
associated with their communications. OWS retains IP address data for a maximum of 30 days.

## Information We May Share
We do not share information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of OWS unless
one of the following circumstances applies:

  * With your consent
      + Crash reports you choose to send to us are shared online.

  * When legally required

      + We will share the information we have with entities outside of OWS if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is necessary to:
          - meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
          - enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
          - detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
          - protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of OWS, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

## Information Security
We work to protect Flock Sync and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. In particular:

  + We encrypt
  + OWS does not have access to any content synced by the Flock application. The complete source code for the clients is available on GitHub, so that interested parties can verify that the application is behaving properly.
  + Flock Sync disclaims any right or technical capacity to decrypt user content.
